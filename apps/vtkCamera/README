Output:
-------

- An image of the specified size with the 2D projections of the selected 3D points.

- A text file with the 3D world coordinates of the selected points. The file has the following structure:
  point_index Xi Yi Zi (one line per point)
     - World reference frame: X points right
                              Y points down
                              Z points forward

- A text file with the 2D projections of the selected 3D points onto the image plane. The file has the following structure:
  point_index xi yi (one line per point)
    - Camera reference frame: x points right
                              y points down
                              z points forward

- A text file with the camera parameters and image properties. The file has the following structure:
  yaw pitch roll tx ty tz f cx cy r width height
